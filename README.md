## Overview

### The challenge

Using an existing Movie API (~https:// )~ [www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) ](http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) provided by The Movie DB, create a website using Vue, Vuex and LESS/SASS with the following functionalities:

#### Home Page
	1. Display all movies
	2. Include Sort options you think would fit best
	3. Search

#### Details Page
	1. Title, summary, poster image, release date, director, language, cast, run time, rating, similar movies, etc.
	2. Add the functionality to rate the movie (you can use any UI you wish for this)

#### Stats Page
	1. Using D3 charts create a simple bar chart for the top 10 rated movies with y- axis being 0 – 10 (rating) and x-axis being the top 10 movies.
	2. Since a Movie can have a rating of 9.0 but had only been rated 2 times, let’s make the stats a little more helpful to the viewers by adding a secondary bar chart below with the Vote / Rating Count. This means the y-axis will now represent the total times a movie has been rated and the x-axis will again represent the top 10 movies.
	3. Use loading animation for the bars and tooltips for both charts.
	4. Use appropriate heading, axis titles and legends for each.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

#### Skills

##### ![HTML](./screenshots/icons/html.png) HTML
I've reinforced my basic skills of HTML and got a better understanding of the semantic tags

##### ![CSS](./screenshots/icons/css3.png) CSS
With this project I was able to retake my previous knowledge of CSS, and get a better grasp of the basics as well as train my capacity to do responsive contents.
I also learned about the new max(), min() and clamp() functions to implement on my next projects.

##### ![JS](./screenshots/icons/javascript.png) Javascript
Most of my time I spent doing the Javascript work... I learned a lot with this project because I had to do most of the JSON handling with Js functions in my Vue methods.

##### ![BOOTSTRAP](./screenshots/icons/bootstrap.png) [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
In this project I was able to get a better understanding about the responsive grid that bootstrap offers. I had the opportunity to use Bootstrap components too, like the Offcanvas component.

##### ![SASS](./screenshots/icons/sass.png) [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
In this project after almost all the CSS part was over I challenged myself to refactor some of the CSS using the SASS, to achieve this I had to actually learn it because it was unknown territory to me.
I can only say that I'm amazed by the strength that this tool offers. I was able to create all the typography and base colors of the project in a dinamic way using @mixins and @each loops through arrays of variables.

##### ![VUEJS](./screenshots/icons/vue.png) [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) 
I've been studying this framework for about 2 months now... And in this project I felt that I used it up to it's potential. 
In this project I were able to solidify my foundations and get a better understanding about how to use all the reactivity with data handling, computed properties and methods to display reactive components with interpolations.

##### [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) Vue Router
With the Vue router I had to do a lot of researchs because of some problems that I had when setting my routes, but I were able to easly fix them with a peek in the documentation, in the process I passed through some things that, despite not using in this project, will be very helpful in specific cases.

##### ![JSON](./screenshots/icons/file.png) JSON Files
The JSON handling methods that I learned with this project will be fundamental to my ability to handle DB requests. I already had some experience in the area, but with this project I solidified my knowledges.


### Useful resources

I've learned so many things in this project, but unfortunatelly I didn't get the URLs, but I can highlight our old friends Google and Youtube and the Stack Overflow community that helped me a lot through this journey.
